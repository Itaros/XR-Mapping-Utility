# XR-Mapping-Utility
Map creation assistance toolkit for XRebirth

## Current Features

  * Creates zone highways from zone A to zone B. No questions asked.

## Notice

Current usability is extremely low as some stuff is hardcoded for testing. 
Will announce proper release when it will be capable to support prefixes and correctly reindex XMLDOM on changes.
